this acts as the dir for the public github: https://github.com/2fixus/html_to_api

This application will serv as a proxy between an html base website and an API, this software and the owner have no control over what is on the HTML side of the proxy, howeer, we have complete control over the API side, the API. 


User will be able to interact with the API an this software will then interact with the html based website, the input from the webste shold only be HTML and possibnly some javascript.   THe API sie should be dynamic enought to change with a differenct website or a different version or a differenet domain all together, the API side should be dynamicly generated and adaptable.
